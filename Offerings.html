                        <h5>An initiative rolled out for schools/ institutions/ organisations passionate about
                            contributing to the environment, wherein individuals are encouraged to practice source
                            segregation and collect waste for a minimum of three months. The segregated waste is
                            collected from schools/offices by team Blue Nudge and is upcycled into plastic benches that
                            are donated on a need basis.

                            We believe that the process instils, in the individuals, and through them in the families,
                            the habit of proper segregation and management of waste, for their lifetime and helps us
                            build a climate conscious society.</h5>

                        <h5>The program aims to provide holistic experiential education related to sustainability and
                            climate change. Participating in this program will serve as a springboard for student’s
                            academic and professional growth. The interactive and problem-solving exposure will open
                            doors for various national and international opportunities and deepen student’s
                            understanding of sustainability and climate change.

                            MSR covers a range of topics related to sustainability, including the impact of climate
                            change, the importance of community engagement, and the need for behavioral change among
                            individuals. Through a combination of lectures, discussions, and hands-on activities, the
                            program helps learners gain a deeper understanding of these topics and develop the skills
                            they need to make a positive impact on the environment.

                            Although the program is not time bound, it is designed to be completed in 3 - 6 months, and
                            is suitable for a wide range of learners, including students, professionals, and community

                            community engagement program for students who feel responsible for the future and are
                            passionate about building a sustainable world. The program consists of online learning
                            modules and community engagement activities.

                            The modules cover nine topics that provide them with a holistic idea of sustainability and
                            the activities provide an on-ground exposure to students. During their community engagement
                            hours, students also extensively participate in a waste collection drive. The plastic and
                            paper collected during the course is upcycled into benches/chairs to be donated to the
                            government schools in India.</h5>
